Whatsapp Mail Facebook Twitter Comentar � La historia de Oza fue en gran medida la historia de la ciudad (hasta 1912 encabez� su propio municipio) y hasta el 30 de noviembre se mostrar� como nunca se ha hecho gracias al trabajo de un historiador entregado a la investigaci�n de este lugar que pas� de 50 a 25.000 habitantes en menos de dos siglos. Es una de las propuestas destacadas de este martes que trae adem�s una nueva conferencia sobre la Bauhaus y una interesante charla de la ensayista Irene Vallejo sobre los or�genes de la literatura. #### Cuatro siglos de historia de Oza La Voz #### M�sica de c�mara con el D�o B.E.S.

Tres a�os en los que armon�a, paciencia y equilibrio permiten que el tempranillo —la uva reina de la Ribera del Duero— alcance todo su car�cter y madurez. Su personalidad se construye desde el origen: vi�edos de las tres zonas principales que conforman la Denominaci�n de Origen Ribera del Duero —Burgos, Valladolid y Soria—, cada una aportando matices �nicos que se funden en un perfil sofisticado y reconocible. A ello se suma una crianza poco habitual: tres maderas diferentes —roble franc�s, americano y austriaco— que enriquecen el vino con capas de aromas y textura, logrando una profundidad que se siente desde el primer sorbo. En nariz despliega notas de fruta madura, especias dulces y un toque tostado muy elegante. En boca es envolvente, sedoso y persistente, con un final memorable. Perfecto para compartir momentos especiales o regalar a quienes reconocen y disfrutan la pasi�n y el respeto que hay detr�s de cada vino. Disponible en la **tienda online** de la bodega PROTOS, del griego “Primero”; Bodega pionera que desde 1927 se ha mantenido fiel a su lema de SER PRIMERO, como una actitud de superaci�n constante en el d�a a d�a y en todos los procesos, estando presentes en m�s de 100 pa�ses. Gracias a su bodega dise�ada por el prestigioso arquitecto ganador del Premio Priztker Sir Richard Rogers, se sit�a una vez m�s, a la vanguardia en el panorama vitivin�cola y enotur�stico, convirti�ndose en la bodega m�s visitada de la Ribera del Duero y en la primera a nivel nacional en obtener el certificado de “marca de excelencia” por Superbrands.

Actualizado a las 09:15 h. Whatsapp Mail Facebook Twitter Comentar � Una mujer fue trasladada al hospital para ser atendida tras haber sufrido inhalaci�n de humo en un **incendio** declarado en una vivienda en el lugar de **Reda**, en el municipio ourensano de **Pi�or**. Los bomberos de O Carballi�o fueron movilizados a media tarde tras recibir el aviso de un fuego en una vivienda. Las llamas se localizaron en una habitaci�n ubicada en la planta superior de la casa. Se trata de un pazo. Este cuarto ardi� completamente y el resto del inmueble qued� afectado por el humo. Los muebles de la habitaci�n, uno de los dormitorios principales de la casa que estaba profusamente decorado, quedaron calcinados y desde esta estancia el humo provocado por las llamas se extendi� al resto del pazo, del siglo XVI. No es la primera vez que los bomberos tienen que acudir a Reda para sofocar un incendio en esta vivienda. En junio del 2019 sus propietarios se llevaron un buen susto al descubrir que estaba ardiendo el piso inferior. El suelo, de madera, hizo que la extinci�n no resultara sencilla. En aquella ocasi�n los da�os que se registraron fueron solo materiales y varias estancias se vieron afectadas por las llamas y por el humo.� Whatsapp Mail Facebook Twitter Comentar �",
