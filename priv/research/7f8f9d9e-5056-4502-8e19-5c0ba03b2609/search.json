But in a place like Torrevieja, where a great number of the Mercadona stores costumers – perhaps the majority – are people from abroad, it doesn´t seems to be a wise business idea. And with this, Mercadona thinks It is a great idea to sell shark meat. Always have shopped at the mercadona but this time I tried the online shopping ... Ordered shopping for holiday - stood outside Villa at allotted time - even thou villa is clearly named and in Los Mojones not out in countryside - watched the Mercadona delivery drive past not stopping and then told driver couldn’t find it - 1st time using this service - on the phone they kept saying it was on its way - wasted so much time on holiday trying to sort out - just an email saying we will refund - very shoddy service. Companies can ask for reviews via automatic invitations.",

The Mercadona case, which Ton has taught in the MBA course Coordinating and Managing Supply Chains, highlights the chain's \"specialists\"—an unusual example of how operations, customer service, employee relations, and profitability are all maximized together. Information also moves out to Mercadona's family of house-brand suppliers, resulting in improvements to a product, to the supply chain, or to employee productivity in the stores. Mercadona always takes store operations into account when making supply-chain decisions, Ton continues, and pays particular attention to the design and management of store processes. Retailers may also make the mistake of focusing on just one aspect of Mercadona's model, such as product assortment or employee stability. \"As soon as I found out about Mercadona, I wanted to write this case to show that offering low prices and making good profits are not in conflict with investing in your employees and your processes,\" she says.",
