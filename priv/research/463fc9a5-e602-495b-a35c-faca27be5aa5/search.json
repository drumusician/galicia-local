Andrea from Customer Care was a student in Santiago de Compostela and highly recommends exploring the new town of Santiago as well as the historic quarter; it doesn’t have the charm and history of the Old Town but you’ll find bars with great tapas and terraces. The Alameda Park (official name: Carballeira de Santa Susana) is Santiago’s green heart and a must-visit: the viewpoint over the University Campus; the colourful statue of As Marias, as well as the statue of writer Valle-Inclán chilling on a bench, are some of Alameda’s best-loved spots. Bonaval Park is both the favourite of Santiago native Tania from our Reservations team and Marketing Manager Maria. The city’s top spot for foodies is Praza de Abastos, or the Santiago food market hall. * Great restaurants in Santiago de Compostela. * Discover the Santiago Food Market in Santiago de Compostela.",
